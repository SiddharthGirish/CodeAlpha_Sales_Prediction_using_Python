# CodeAlpha_Sales_Prediction_using_Python
Sales Prediction Data Science Project

**Goal:**  
  -> Predict future product sales based on **advertising spend**, **target segment**, and **platform**.

**What I did:**
  -> Cleaned and explored the advertising dataset.
  -> Visualized relationships between TV, Radio, Newspaper spend, and Sales.
  -> Built a **Linear Regression Model** to forecast sales.
  -> Evaluated model accuracy with **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **RÂ² Score**.
  -> Created clear plots: correlation heatmaps, pairplots, scatter plots, residual plots.

**Key Libraries:**  
  -> `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
